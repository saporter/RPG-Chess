/*
 * This command works closely with the UI system.  See button scripts in UI folder for those 
 * buttons (and parent panels) that listen for the PawnPromotion event.
 * 
 * PromotionCommand takes a string arument to work with different promotion types.  This allows
 * different pop-up windows to be displayed that are customized to each promoted piece.
 * This way, since special pieces promote to different piece types, you can customize the pop-up
 * window however you like in the editor then attach a script that listens for the right event (called with the 
 * corresponding string parameter - see Pawn for an example).
